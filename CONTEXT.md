# todo-app

This file is the project's glossary.
It names only the terms this repo coins or overloads — terms carrying their ordinary meaning (id, test, list) are left alone where nothing here bends them.

## The domain

Every entry keeps one shape: the bold term and its definition on one line, each further fact on its own line, then an `_Avoid_:` line of the synonyms this repo does not use.
Where a named error refuses a value, the entry names that error, as **Title** does.

**Todo**: one thing somebody means to do, carrying an **id**, a **title** and its completion.
A todo is read-only to callers: the **todo list** replaces it rather than mutating it, so a todo handed out earlier never changes underneath the code holding it.
_Avoid_: task, item, entry.

**Title**: the sentence a **todo** is named by, trimmed of surrounding whitespace and never empty.
A title that is empty once trimmed is not a title, and is refused with `InvalidTitleError`.
_Avoid_: name, description, label.

**Completion**: whether a **todo** is done, as the single boolean `completed`.
A todo is **open** until it is completed, and completing one is reversible — reopening it is ordinary, not a correction.
_Avoid_: status, state, done flag.

**Todo list**: the whole collection, and the only thing that creates a **todo** or changes one.
It hands out the **id**s itself, so nothing outside it invents one.
_Avoid_: store, repository, collection, database.

**Insertion order**: the order todos were added, and the order a **listing** comes back in when it is not asked for another.
Changing a **todo** does not move it: completing or renaming one leaves it where it was.
_Avoid_: natural order, default order.

**Filter**: which **todo**s a **listing** asks for: `all`, `open`, or `completed`.
A filter says what a listing holds, never what order it holds it in.
_Avoid_: query, selector, predicate.

**Listing**: one answer from the **todo list** to what a caller asked of it, as a fresh array.
Holding a listing does not hold the list: a later add does not appear in a listing already returned.
_Avoid_: view, snapshot, result set.

**Search**: text asked of the **todo list**, answering the **listing** of **todo**s whose **title** contains it.
Both the title and the text are trimmed and folded to the same case before matching, so neither is privileged.
Text that is empty once trimmed matches no todo.
A search composes with a **filter**: either narrows which todos the other considers.
_Avoid_: query, keyword, lookup.
